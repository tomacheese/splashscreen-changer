## ✨ Features

- Random setting from prepared images for each startup
- Automatic processing of prepared images without the need to resize or crop them in advance
- Can be used with applications other than VRChat, as long as they use EasyAntiCheat
- If you want to use it for VRChat, you can start using it without creating a configuration file
- Can run with a single executable file

## 🚀 Installation

There are several ways to install this application.  
Please see the link for specific installation instructions.

- [Portable installation by executable file (exe)](installation/portable.md) (Recommended)
- [Installation by Scoop](installation/scoop.md)
- [Installation by go install](installation/go-install.md)

## 🛠️ Settings

If you want to customize the behavior of this application, you will need a configuration file.  
Please see the [configuration file](settings/file.md) page for details on how to set up.

The application also sets a random image each time it is run.  
Therefore, if you want to change the splash screen periodically under some condition, an [automatic starting](settings/autostart/index.md) setting is required.
